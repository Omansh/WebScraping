Awesome,good product
Great product,Good Mobile    Camera clarity is excellent  
Wonderful,Its an excellent device for people shifting to smartphone  2GB ram looks enough  Not meant for Gaming  Solitaire and candy crush will be fine  This device has 19 9 aspect ratio  Having bezels is good for beginners  They are not used to hold drop notch display phones and do kind of mess Camera is below average but does the purpose  Video calling and occasional photography will be fine Out of the box  52  ram was occuiped and 22 GB space was available  There is no IR blaster  Speaker is als
